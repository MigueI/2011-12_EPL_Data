# 2011-12_EPL_Data

I want to get better at R, and the best way to do that is
by making stuff with it. I'll try my hand at analyzing some 
soccer data and see what I can find! 

The data set was published by Manchester City F.C. in 2012, 
and contains a bunch of collected measurements for every 
player in every game throughout the 2011-2012 English Premier 
League season. There are ~200 variables for each player's 
match performance, of which there are about 10,000 different 
permutations. You'll find the data in MCData2012.csv.

Note: The ranking data in the R notebook 
is scraped off of Wikipedia, so if errors start popping up,
make sure to check that it's not grabbing the wrong data
from some recently added table.
